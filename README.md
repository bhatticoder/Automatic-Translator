If you want to use this project to run on your local machine. 
Here are some steps you have to do.

#2    Make a template folder and place all the html files in template folder\
#3    main.py in you parent folder
#Important to remember.
I have created this project using Google Translation API key. So I have not provided my api key in Github. Because github doesnot allow this and also that I purchased that api-key for my project.
The other thing is that training your own new models from the scratch is not easy and time taking and also requires GPU. If you have enough GPU like RTX 3090 you can train your own translation models that doesn't require api key and is free of cost. 
By using Hugging Face Transformers for text a model of generative AI you can easily build your own trarnslator model.
